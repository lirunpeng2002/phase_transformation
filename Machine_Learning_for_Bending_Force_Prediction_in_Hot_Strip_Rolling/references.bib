The generalization error for forests converges a.s. to a limit as the number of trees in the forest becomes large. The generalization error of a forest of tree classifiers depends on the strength of the individual trees in the forest and the correlation between them. Using a random selection of features to split each node yields error rates that compare favorably to Adaboost (Y. Freund \& R. Schapire, Machine Learning: Proceedings of the Thirteenth International conference, ***, 148–156), but are more robust with respect to noise. Internal estimates monitor error, strength, and correlation and these are used to show the response to increasing the number of features used in the splitting. Internal estimates are also used to measure variable importance. These ideas are also applicable to regression.},

A general gradient descent “boosting” paradigm is developed for additive expansions based on any fitting criterion.Specific algorithms are presented for least-squares, least absolute deviation, and Huber-M loss functions for regression, and multiclass logistic likelihood for classification. Special enhancements are derived for the particular case where the individual additive components are regression trees, and tools for interpreting such “TreeBoost” models are presented. Gradient boosting of regression trees produces competitive, highly robust, interpretable procedures for both regression and classification, especially appropriate for mining less than clean data.

Due to the physical, mechanical, and chemical complexities involved in the process, conventional monitoring and control methods are often pushed to their limits. The increasing global competition has created a demand for new methods to monitor and control the BOF steelmaking process. Over the past decade, Machine Learning (ML) techniques have garnered substantial attention, offering a promising pathway to enhance efficiency and suitability of steel production. This paper presents the first comprehensive review of ML applications in the BOF steelmaking process. We provide an introduction to both fields: an overview of the BOF steelmaking process and ML. We analyze the existing work on ML applications in BOF steelmaking and synthesize common concepts into categories, supporting the identification of common use cases and approaches. This analysis concludes with the elaboration of challenges, potential solutions, and a future outlook for further research directions.},

	abstract = {The accuracy of rolling force prediction is key to improving the precision of strip thickness control. The compressive load required for the strip in the rolling process is not only related to the size of the billet and process parameters such as deformation speed, temperature, and reduction, but also to the deformation boundary conditions of the billet between the rolls, such as the wear state of the rolls, lubrication conditions, etc. These influencing factors are interrelated and constantly changing, which is particularly prominent in small-batch and multi-specification intermittent production modes. The existing rolling force prediction models are constructed based on the rolling deformation mechanism through numerous simplifications. Due to challenges in fully and accurately characterizing various complex rolling deformation processes, their mapping relationships with process parameters, and constantly changing boundary conditions, the accuracy of the simplified rolling force prediction model is difficult to meet the control requirements of actual production. This paper proposes a physics-guided data-driven (PGDD) rolling force modeling method. It separates rolling condition features into static and dynamic parts using mechanistic and empirical knowledge and introduces a machine learning framework that integrates these parts for modeling. In this framework, the static feature fitting part can establish the influence of process parameters such as billet chemical composition, size, rolling speed, temperature, etc. on the rolling force. Meanwhile, the dynamic feature fitting part is responsible for the collaborative modeling of influencing factors reflecting the evolution rules of roll state, learning the cumulative effects of various complex processing states from a large amount of time-series data formed by different combinations of rolling conditions. Experiments with real production condition data show that the proposed physics-guided data-driven modeling method can accurately predict the rolling force under complex and variable conditions, and its adaptability and accuracy are superior to the online original model and traditional data-driven model.},

	abstract = {With the development of automation and informatization in the steelmaking industry, the human brain gradually fails to cope with an increasing amount of data generated during the steelmaking process. Machine learning technology provides a new method other than production experience and metallurgical principles in dealing with large amounts of data. The application of machine learning in the steelmaking process has become a research hotspot in recent years. This paper provides an overview of the applications of machine learning in the steelmaking process modeling involving hot metal pretreatment, primary steelmaking, secondary refining, and some other aspects. The three most frequently used machine learning algorithms in steelmaking process modeling are the artificial neural network, support vector machine, and case-based reasoning, demonstrating proportions of 56\%, 14\%, and 10\%, respectively. Collected data in the steelmaking plants are frequently faulty. Thus, data processing, especially data cleaning, is crucially important to the performance of machine learning models. The detection of variable importance can be used to optimize the process parameters and guide production. Machine learning is used in hot metal pretreatment modeling mainly for endpoint S content prediction. The predictions of the endpoints of element compositions and the process parameters are widely investigated in primary steelmaking. Machine learning is used in secondary refining modeling mainly for ladle furnaces, Ruhrstahl–Heraeus, vacuum degassing, argon oxygen decarburization, and vacuum oxygen decarburization processes. Further development of machine learning in the steelmaking process modeling can be realized through additional efforts in the construction of the data platform, the industrial transformation of the research achievements to the practical steelmaking process, and the improvement of the universality of the machine learning models.},
